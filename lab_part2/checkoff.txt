This checkoff assessment is intended to check comprehension of concepts explored in this lab, including:
- Imitation Learning
- Vision Language Models (VLMs)
- Vision Language Action Models (VLAs)
- GenAI x Safety

You will be asked a random selection of 3 of the 6 questions below.
For each question, you are expected to:
- Answer with one proof or reasoning step that demonstrates knowledge from the assignment

Checkoff questions
1. What is the input and output of the BLIP image-captioning VLM implemented in this lab? Are these the only possible input(s) and output(s) to a VLM?
2. What does a VLA stand for? How does it relate to a VLM?
3. What is the input and output of the Pi0 VLA? Are these the only possible input(s) and output(s) to a VLA?
4. What is a foundational model? Would GPT-4 be considered a foundational model? BLIP captioning? Pi0?
5. What are some safety concerns about generative AI models (VLMs, VLAs) being implemented into robotic pipelines?
6. What does safety mean to you in the context of robotics? How comfortable would you feel using GenAI in real world deployments? How might you design better safety guarantees for these models (using your definition of safety and what you’ve learned in this course so far)?
