# Part 2: Generative AI x Robotics

The imitation learning model introduced in part 1 can be generalized to a vast collection of generative AI models to support robotics. In part 2 of this lab, you will explore some of the generative AI models being used in today's robotics research and development including ChatGPT, CLIP, BLIP, and SmolVLA.

Walk through the Jupyter notebooks in this repository in order. Answer the activity reflection questions throughout the notebooks with your lab partner. When you have finished the safety notebook, complete the lab checkoff with a TA.
