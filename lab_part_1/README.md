# Part 1: Imitation Learning

The first part of this lab will introduce imitation learning and policy training with expert demonstrations, an important machine learning approach to training a robot to complete a desired task. Later, in the second part of the lab, this initial imitation learning model will be generalized to generative AI models.

Walk through the Jupyter notebook in this repository before proceeding to Part 2. Answer the activity reflection questions throughout the notebooks with your lab partner. When you have finished the notebook, proceed to [Part 2](https://github.com/abbykoneill/lerobot/blob/main/lab_part2/README.md).
